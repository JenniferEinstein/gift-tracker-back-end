I don't know why I didn't put this in here before.
I am restarting working on this at the end of June 2024.

- [x]  A route exists to create new resources.
- [x]  A route exists to read all resources.
- [x]  A route exists to read a single resource.
- [x]  A route exists to update a single resource.
- [x]  A route exists to delete a single resource.
- [x]  An appropriate "Not Found" response is given when a route is requested that does not match the created routes.

installed npm i react-router-dom  on the client side. Hope that was right.

In the back end in app.js (Except I have this in index.js instead):
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // TODO: Add application-wide middleware
    app.use(cors());
    // TODO: Add controller(s)
    // TODO: Implement health check route

module.exports = app;

=================
In client, added .env and the following folders under src: components, images, and pages.

I also added the following pages:
 - About.jsx
 - Administration.jsx
 - Gallery.jsx
 - PageNotFound.jsx
 - HomePage.jsx

 Added the following components:
 Header.jsx LoginModal.jsx Navbar.jsx Footer.jsx 
 - FAQ.jsx and filled in with dummy text.
 - PrivacyPolicy.jsx and filled in basic template.
 - TermsOfService.jsx and filled in basic template.
